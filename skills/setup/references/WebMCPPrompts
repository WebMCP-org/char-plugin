anythings your write with window.navigator.registerPrompt... or  useWebMCPPrompt({... will show up as a "suggetion" in the char ai agent.

This is a great way to tell the user what they can do on a page. these are dynamic like webmcp tools,

This is an essential part of any good app. You generally want to shoot for 1-4 prompts per page, if you have more than that, than you can do too much on a page. you can also make them base on application state.


 useWebMCPPrompt({
    name: "Set up my identity provider",
    description: "Help me configure SSO authentication for my widget",
    get: () => ({
      messages: [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: {
            type: "text",
            text: "Help me configure SSO authentication for my widget",
          },
        },
      ],
    }),
  });
